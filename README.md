        // Create RecyclerView data adapter
		mAdapter = new PictureAdapter(this);
		// Set RecyclerView data adapter
        mWrapRecyclerView.setAdapter(mAdapter);

- You can get the **wrapper adapter** by **WrapRecyclerView**

        // Gets the wrapper adapter because you should to use it to refresh the data
        WrapAdapter mWrapAdapter = mWrapRecyclerView.getAdapter();

        mAdapter.setItemLists(pictureData.pictures);

- Provides an **BaseRecyclerAdapter** to facilitate the operation of your adapter data

### WrapAdapter

- WrapAdapter is used as a RecyclerView.Adapter wrapper class to add the header and footer to the RecyclerView.

		// Create RecyclerView data adapter
		PictureAdapter pictureAdapter = new PictureAdapter(this);
		// Create adapter wrapper
		mWrapAdapter = new WrapAdapter<>(pictureAdapter);
		// set the header and footer to be added as a row
		mWrapAdapter.adjustSpanSize(mRecyclerView);
		// Set RecyclerView data adapter (adapter wrapper)
		mRecyclerView.setAdapter(mWrapAdapter);

- Add header footer layout

		mWrapAdapter.addHeaderView(headerView);
		mWrapAdapter.addFooterView(footerView);

- You can get the real data adapter by **wrapper adapter**.

		PictureAdapter pictureAdapter = mWrapAdapter.getWrappedAdapter();

		// Gets the real data adapter and sets the data
		mWrapAdapter.getWrappedAdapter().setItemLists(pictureData.pictures);
		// Wrapper adapter notification data change
		mWrapAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
